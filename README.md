## Project Overview

This is a static, multi-page promotional website for **Roar Cycle**, a mobile bike repair service based in Dublin. The project is primarily built using **Native HTML5 and CSS3**, focusing on demonstrating mastery of core web technologies without relying on external frontend frameworks like Bootstrap.

The project encompasses two main pages:
1.  **Homepage (`index.html`)**: Features the core value proposition, hero section, and service highlights.
2.  **Contact Page (`contact-us.html`)**: Contains a comprehensive contact form for customer inquiries.

### Layout & Design Highlights

* **Flexbox-Driven Layouts:**
    * **Header & Navigation:** Achieved a clean, responsive alignment using `display: flex` and `justify-content: space-between`.
    * **Hero Section (`main`)**: Successfully implemented a two-column layout where content and image are sized proportionally using **Flex properties** (e.g., `flex: 2` and `flex: 1`).
    * **Service Cards:** Structured the three service cards using Flexbox for easy spacing and centering.
* **Pure CSS Dropdown:** Implemented a functional dropdown menu on the "Book Online" navigation item using the **`:hover` pseudo-class** and `position: absolute` for positioning.
* **Custom Styling:** Applied a distinct visual style with a **CSS `linear-gradient` background** (`#FC5E55` to `#FA4083`) and a subtle texture image (`image-lion-background.png`) in the background.
* **Form Design:** The contact form is structured for clarity, utilizing various HTML5 input types and custom CSS to ensure full-width input fields (`box-sizing: border-box`).
